Contributing
------------

1. Fork it on github
2. Make a local clone of your fork
3. Create a topic branch.  Eg, `feature/mousetrap`
4. Make/commit changes
    * Commit messages should be in [imperative tense](http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html)
    * Check that linter warnings or errors are not introduced - `bundle exec rake lint`
    * Check that `Rspec-puppet` unit tests are not broken and coverage is added for new
      features - `bundle exec rake spec`
    * Documentation of API/features is updated as appropriate in the README
    * If present, `beaker` acceptance tests should be run and potentially
      updated - `bundle exec rake beaker`
5. When the feature is complete, rebase / squash the branch history as
   necessary to remove "fix typo", "oops", "whitespace" and other trivial commits
6. Push the topic branch to github
7. Open a Pull Request (PR) from the *topic branch* onto parent repo's `master` branch
